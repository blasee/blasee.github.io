title: "About Me"

I am a statistical consultant at the Statistical Consulting Centre in the 
Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland. I am an avid **R** 
programmer and data analyst. This is my personal website where I am able to 
keep all of my projects in one accessible repository. Most of these projects 
are the product of my spare time.
